SUBJECT: MISSION REPORT – OYSOGA EXPEDITIONARY RETURN

BODY:

MISSION RETURN AND DATA SUMMARY:

The Alpha Team has successfully concluded the OYSOGA Mission, returning at W2230 on 11.12 with an extensive repository of critical data.
The mission was tasked with acquiring shards from various parts of the universe. The returned data includes vital files necessary for opening the dimensional gateway.

IMMINENT EVENT – GATEWAY ACTIVATION:

The dimensional gateway is set to open on 15.12 at 23:59.
The exact coordinates of the gateway remain elusive, and decoding the attached data files is essential to pinpoint the location.
Signal decryption is ongoing, but further decoding is required to secure the coordinates before the opening.
#17.WP9 – SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

#17.WP9 does not contain the gateway’s coordinates, but instead provides a partial clue that ties into a secondary mission task.
Complete decryption of the attached data files is required before 15.12 at 23:59 to facilitate further action.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Primary Objective: Focus on decoding the attached files to pinpoint the gateway's location before 15.12 at 23:59.
Secondary Objective: Locate decryption tools to fully decode #17.WP9 and related files before the deadline. For urgent assistance, direct contact with JCO3R is advised.
Assign cryptology teams and secure-state resources to real-time analysis, ensuring readiness for the event.
Further Research: Following the opening of the gateway on 15.12, further analysis will be conducted to determine the full implications and details, 
with anticipated findings by EOY.
